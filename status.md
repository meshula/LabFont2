# LabFont2 Status Report

## Overview

This report documents the current status of LabFont2 after cloning the repository. The goal is to assess the buildability of the advertised targets and the functionality of the tests.

## Build Status

| Target | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Core Library | ✅ Success | The core library builds successfully without any backends. |
| Metal Backend | ❌ Failure | Build fails with multiple errors in `metal_backend.mm` and `metal_command_buffer.h`. Issues include undefined types and missing enum members. |
| Vulkan Backend | ❌ Failure | Build fails due to missing MoltenVK dependency. The error message suggests installing the LunarG Vulkan SDK. |
| WebGPU Backend | ❌ Failure | Build fails due to missing header `webgpu/webgpu_cpp.h`. |
| WebAssembly | ❓ Unknown | The build script requires Emscripten environment which wasn't properly set up. |
| Examples | ❌ Failure | Build fails due to missing GLFW dependency. |

## Test Status

| Test Suite | Status | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------|
| Unit Tests | ❌ Failure | Tests fail to compile due to mismatches between test code and actual API. There appear to be discrepancies in function signatures and type names. |

## Evaluation

LabFont2 appears to be in an early development stage with several incomplete or non-functional components. The core library builds successfully, but all specialized backends (Metal, Vulkan, WebGPU) fail to build due to various issues:

1. **Metal Backend**: The implementation has several type errors and inconsistencies with the core API. It references undefined types like `Vertex` and uses enum members that don't exist in the core types.

2. **Vulkan Backend**: The build system correctly detects Vulkan but fails due to missing MoltenVK, which is required for Vulkan support on macOS.

3. **WebGPU Backend**: Missing header files suggest that the WebGPU dependencies aren't properly installed or configured.

4. **Tests**: The test code doesn't match the current API implementation, suggesting that either the tests or the API have been updated without keeping the other in sync.

5. **Examples**: The examples require GLFW, which isn't included in the repository or listed as a dependency in the build instructions.

The project's README advertises features that don't appear to be fully implemented yet, such as text rendering with styling and layout. The code structure is in place, but many components seem to be incomplete or non-functional.

## Proposed Next Steps

### For Colleagues

1. **Focus on the Core Library**: The core library builds successfully and could be a starting point for exploration.

2. **Install Dependencies**: To test the various backends, install:
   - LunarG Vulkan SDK (for Vulkan backend)
   - WebGPU development libraries (for WebGPU backend)
   - GLFW (for examples)

3. **Examine API Design**: Review the API design in `include/labfont/labfont.h` to understand the intended functionality.

4. **Contribute Tests**: Update the test suite to match the current API implementation.

#### Checklist

[x] The Vulkan SDK is at /Users/nick/VulkanSDK/1.4.304.1/macOS/include/volk ~ let's figure out why the cmake scripts can't find it, and see if we can fix the CMakeLists.txt file, then update the script, the readme, and commit it.
   - Created a configure.py script that automatically detects the Vulkan SDK and generates appropriate build scripts
   - Updated the README.md with instructions on how to use the configure.py script

[x] The emscriptem system wasn't detected. Perhaps the CMake script should detect that it isn't installed and attempt to report it. Are the instructions sufficient to teach another colleague how to install it? Prepare a commit.
   - The configure.py script now detects Emscripten and provides clear instructions if it's not found
   - Updated the build_wasm.sh script to be generated by configure.py with the correct paths

[x] Since glfw wasn't found, we should think about what to do about that.
   - Updated examples/CMakeLists.txt to properly detect and use GLFW
   - The configure.py script now checks for GLFW and provides installation instructions if it's not found
   - Examples will be disabled if GLFW is not available, with a clear warning message


### For LabFont2 Authors

1. **Fix Backend Implementations**: Address the compilation errors in the Metal, Vulkan, and WebGPU backends.

2. **Update Tests**: Ensure tests are in sync with the current API implementation.

3. **Clarify Dependencies**: Update the README with a complete list of dependencies, including GLFW for examples.

4. **Provide Build Instructions for All Platforms**: The current build scripts are macOS-specific and some have hardcoded paths.

5. **Implement Missing Features**: Several advertised features like text rendering with styling and layout appear to be incomplete.

6. **Add Documentation**: Provide more detailed documentation on how to use the library and its various features.

7. **Include Sample Fonts**: Consider including sample fonts for testing and examples.
