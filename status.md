# LabFont2 Status Report

## Overview

This report documents the current status of LabFont2 after cloning the repository. The goal is to assess the buildability of the advertised targets and the functionality of the tests.

## Build Status

| Target | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Core Library | ✅ Success | The core library builds successfully without any backends. |
| Metal Backend | ✅ Success | The Metal backend builds successfully, but examples fail due to missing WebGPU header. |
| Vulkan Backend | ✅ Success | The Vulkan backend builds successfully, but examples fail due to missing WebGPU header. |
| WebGPU Backend | ❌ Failure | Build fails due to incomplete type 'labfont::WebGPUDevice' and missing implementation. |
| WebAssembly | ❌ Failure | The build process starts but fails due to WebGPU backend issues. |
| Examples | ❌ Failure | Examples fail to build due to direct WebGPU dependency in drawing_main.cpp. |

## Test Status

| Test Suite | Status | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------|
| Unit Tests | ⚠️ Partial | Some core tests pass, but many tests fail with assertion errors. Vulkan tests fail with errors related to MoltenVK. |

## Evaluation

LabFont2 appears to be in an early development stage with several incomplete or non-functional components. The core library and some backends (Metal, Vulkan) build successfully, but there are still issues with the WebGPU backend and examples:

1. **Metal Backend**: ✅ Success. The implementation builds successfully, but examples fail due to WebGPU dependency.

2. **Vulkan Backend**: ✅ Success. The backend builds successfully, but examples fail due to WebGPU dependency.

3. **WebGPU Backend**: ❌ Incomplete. The WebGPU backend has incomplete type definitions and missing implementations, causing build failures even with Emscripten properly set up.

4. **Tests**: ⚠️ Partially working. Some core tests pass, but many fail with assertion errors. Vulkan tests fail with errors related to MoltenVK.

5. **Examples**: ❌ Failure. The examples directly include WebGPU headers instead of using the LabFont abstraction, which contradicts the library's design goals.

The project's README advertises features that don't appear to be fully implemented yet, such as text rendering with styling and layout. The code structure is in place, but many components seem to be incomplete or non-functional.

## Proposed Next Steps

### For Colleagues

1. **Focus on the Core Library**: The core library builds successfully and could be a starting point for exploration.

2. **Install Dependencies**: To test the various backends, install:
   - LunarG Vulkan SDK (for Vulkan backend)
   - WebGPU development libraries (for WebGPU backend)
   - GLFW (for examples)

3. **Examine API Design**: Review the API design in `include/labfont/labfont.h` to understand the intended functionality.

4. **Contribute Tests**: Update the test suite to match the current API implementation.

#### Checklist

- [x] Verify core library builds successfully
- [x] Verify Metal backend builds successfully
- [x] Verify Vulkan backend builds successfully
- [x] Verify WebGPU backend fails with incomplete type errors
- [x] Verify examples fail to build with WebGPU dependency error
- [x] Verify unit tests partially pass with some failures
- [x] Run all build scripts to verify current status
- [ ] Investigate test failures and propose fixes
- [ ] Analyze WebGPU backend implementation requirements


### For LabFont2 Authors

1. **Fix Backend Implementations**: Address the compilation errors in the WebGPU backend.

2. **Update Tests**: Ensure tests are in sync with the current API implementation and fix failing tests.

3. **Clarify Dependencies**: Update the README with a complete list of dependencies, including GLFW for examples.

4. **Provide Build Instructions for All Platforms**: The current build scripts are macOS-specific and some have hardcoded paths.

5. **Implement Missing Features**: Several advertised features like text rendering with styling and layout appear to be incomplete.

6. **Add Documentation**: Provide more detailed documentation on how to use the library and its various features.

7. **Include Sample Fonts**: Consider including sample fonts for testing and examples.

#### Checklist (Prioritized by Dependencies)

1. **Core API and Type Definitions**:
   - [x] Define and implement missing core types (Vertex, DrawCommand, etc.)
   - [x] Ensure consistent enum definitions across the codebase
   - [x] Implement missing core functions (CreateBackend, lab_create_buffer, lab_create_texture)

2. **Backend Implementations**:
   - [x] Fix Metal backend errors
   - [x] Fix Vulkan backend errors
   - [ ] Fix WebGPU backend errors:
     - [x] Update build_wasm.sh to properly source the Emscripten environment
     - [x] Implement conditional compilation for WebGPU headers
