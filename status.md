# LabFont2 Status Report

## Overview

This report documents the current status of LabFont2 after cloning the repository. The goal is to assess the buildability of the advertised targets and the functionality of the tests.

## Build Status

| Target | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Core Library | ✅ Success | The core library builds successfully without any backends. |
| Metal Backend | ❌ Failure | Build fails with multiple errors in `metal_backend.mm` and `metal_command_buffer.h`. Issues include undefined types and missing enum members. |
| Vulkan Backend | ✅ Success | The Vulkan backend builds successfully, but the tests fail to compile. |
| WebGPU Backend | ❌ Failure | Build fails due to incomplete type 'labfont::WebGPUDevice' and missing implementation. |
| WebAssembly | ✅ Success | The build_wasm.sh script now provides clear installation instructions for Emscripten, and the build process starts but fails due to WebGPU backend issues. |
| Examples | ⚠️ Skipped | Examples are skipped due to missing GLFW dependency. The build system detects the missing dependency and disables the examples rather than failing. |

## Test Status

| Test Suite | Status | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------|
| Unit Tests | ❌ Failure | Tests fail to compile due to mismatches between test code and actual API. There appear to be discrepancies in function signatures and type names. |

## Evaluation

LabFont2 appears to be in an early development stage with several incomplete or non-functional components. The core library builds successfully, but all specialized backends (Metal, Vulkan, WebGPU) fail to build due to various issues:

1. **Metal Backend**: The implementation has several type errors and inconsistencies with the core API. It references undefined types like `Vertex` and uses enum members that don't exist in the core types.

2. **Vulkan Backend**: The build system correctly detects Vulkan and the backend builds successfully, but the tests fail to compile due to API mismatches.

3. **WebGPU Backend**: The WebGPU backend has incomplete type definitions and missing implementations, causing build failures even with Emscripten properly set up.

4. **Tests**: The test code doesn't match the current API implementation, suggesting that either the tests or the API have been updated without keeping the other in sync.

5. **Examples**: The examples require GLFW, which isn't included in the repository or listed as a dependency in the build instructions. When GLFW is not found, the examples are skipped rather than failing to build.

The project's README advertises features that don't appear to be fully implemented yet, such as text rendering with styling and layout. The code structure is in place, but many components seem to be incomplete or non-functional.

## Proposed Next Steps

### For Colleagues

1. **Focus on the Core Library**: The core library builds successfully and could be a starting point for exploration.

2. **Install Dependencies**: To test the various backends, install:
   - LunarG Vulkan SDK (for Vulkan backend)
   - WebGPU development libraries (for WebGPU backend)
   - GLFW (for examples)

3. **Examine API Design**: Review the API design in `include/labfont/labfont.h` to understand the intended functionality.

4. **Contribute Tests**: Update the test suite to match the current API implementation.

### For LabFont2 Authors

1. **Fix Backend Implementations**: Address the compilation errors in the Metal, Vulkan, and WebGPU backends.

2. **Update Tests**: Ensure tests are in sync with the current API implementation.

3. **Clarify Dependencies**: Update the README with a complete list of dependencies, including GLFW for examples.

4. **Provide Build Instructions for All Platforms**: The current build scripts are macOS-specific and some have hardcoded paths.

5. **Implement Missing Features**: Several advertised features like text rendering with styling and layout appear to be incomplete.

6. **Add Documentation**: Provide more detailed documentation on how to use the library and its various features.

7. **Include Sample Fonts**: Consider including sample fonts for testing and examples.

#### Checklist

- [ ] Fix Metal backend errors:
  - [ ] Unknown type name 'Vertex' in metal_command_buffer.h
  - [ ] Issues with DrawCommandType not being implicitly convertible to int
  - [ ] Missing members in DrawCommand struct (blend, scissor, viewport)
- [ ] Fix test suite errors:
  - [ ] Mismatch between test code and API implementation (lab_result vs lab_operation_result)
  - [ ] Incorrect function signatures in tests
- [x] Improve build scripts:
  - [x] Updated configure.py to generate a build_wasm.sh script with clear installation instructions for Emscripten
  - [x] Verified that Emscripten can be successfully installed and the build process starts
- [ ] Fix WebGPU backend errors:
  - [ ] Incomplete type 'labfont::WebGPUDevice'
  - [ ] Missing implementation of WebGPU device and related components
