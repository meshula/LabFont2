# LabFont2 Status Report

## Overview

This report documents the current status of LabFont2 after cloning the repository. The goal is to assess the buildability of the advertised targets and the functionality of the tests.

## Build Status

| Target | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Core Library | ✅ Success | The core library builds successfully without any backends. |
| Metal Backend | ✅ Success | The Metal backend builds successfully, but examples fail due to missing WebGPU header. |
| Vulkan Backend | ✅ Success | The Vulkan backend builds successfully, but examples fail due to missing WebGPU header. |
| WebGPU Backend | ⚠️ Partial | The WebGPU backend now builds successfully, but the implementation is still incomplete. |
| WebAssembly | ⚠️ Partial | The WebAssembly build now succeeds with the WebGPU backend, but functionality is limited. |
| Examples | ❌ Failure | Examples fail to build due to direct WebGPU dependency in drawing_main.cpp. |

## Test Status

### Test Organization

| Backend | Context | Resources | Error | Memory | Backend-specific |
|---------|---------|-----------|-------|--------|-----------------|
| CPU     | ✅ test_cpu_context.c | ✅ test_cpu_resources.c | ✅ test_cpu_error.c | ✅ test_cpu_memory.c | ✅ test_cpu_backend.cpp |
| Metal   | - | - | - | - | ✅ test_metal_backend.cpp |
| Vulkan  | - | - | - | - | ✅ test_vulkan_backend.cpp |
| WebGPU  | - | - | - | - | ✅ test_wgpu_backend.cpp |

### Test Status Summary

| Test Suite | Status | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------|
| Unit Tests | ⚠️ Partial | Tests now follow the naming convention `test_BACKEND_feature.c/cpp`. Some core tests pass, but many tests fail with assertion errors. Vulkan tests fail with errors related to MoltenVK. |

## Evaluation

LabFont2 appears to be in an early development stage with several incomplete or non-functional components. The core library and some backends (Metal, Vulkan) build successfully, but there are still issues with the WebGPU backend and examples:

1. **Metal Backend**: ✅ Success. The implementation builds successfully, but examples fail due to WebGPU dependency.

2. **Vulkan Backend**: ✅ Success. The backend builds successfully, but examples fail due to WebGPU dependency.

3. **WebGPU Backend**: ⚠️ Partial. The WebGPU backend now builds successfully with Emscripten, but the implementation is still incomplete and requires further development.

4. **Tests**: ⚠️ Partially working. Some core tests pass, but many fail with assertion errors. Vulkan tests fail with errors related to MoltenVK.

5. **Examples**: ❌ Failure. The examples directly include WebGPU headers instead of using the LabFont abstraction, which contradicts the library's design goals.

The project's README advertises features that don't appear to be fully implemented yet, such as text rendering with styling and layout. The code structure is in place, but many components seem to be incomplete or non-functional.

## Proposed Next Steps

### For Colleagues

1. **Focus on the Core Library**: The core library builds successfully and could be a starting point for exploration.

2. **Install Dependencies**: To test the various backends, install:
   - LunarG Vulkan SDK (for Vulkan backend)
   - WebGPU development libraries (for WebGPU backend)
   - GLFW (for examples)

3. **Examine API Design**: Review the API design in `include/labfont/labfont.h` to understand the intended functionality.

4. **Contribute Tests**: Update the test suite to match the current API implementation.

### Author's Prioritized Checklist

1. **Core Functionality and Error Handling**:
   - [x] Define and implement missing core types (Vertex, DrawCommand, etc.)
   - [x] Ensure consistent enum definitions across the codebase
   - [x] Implement missing core functions (CreateBackend, lab_create_buffer, lab_create_texture)
   - [x] Improve error handling with more descriptive error codes and messages (current -7 error code is not descriptive)

2. **Backend Implementations**:
   - [x] Fix Metal backend errors
   - [x] Fix Vulkan backend errors
   - [ ] Fix WebGPU backend errors:
     - [x] Update build_wasm.sh to properly source the Emscripten environment
     - [x] Implement conditional compilation for WebGPU headers
     - [x] Implement the WebGPUDevice class that is currently only forward-declared
     - [x] Fix namespace inconsistencies (wgpu::WGPUBackend vs labfont::WGPUBackend)
     - [x] Resolve redefinition errors in wgpu_texture.cpp
     - [x] Fix incomplete type errors and forward declarations
     - [ ] Complete the WebGPUDevice class implementation
     - [ ] Implement missing WebGPU backend functionality

3. **Test Framework and Fixes**:
   - [x] Standardize test naming convention to `test_BACKEND_feature.c/cpp`
   - [ ] Fix backend test failures:
     - [ ] Address assertion failures in Metal tests (LAB_ERROR_NONE vs -7)
     - [ ] Fix MoltenVK conflicts in Vulkan tests (duplicate class implementation)
     - [ ] Resolve conflicts between multiple MoltenVK libraries on macOS
   - [ ] Expand test coverage:
     - [ ] Create Metal, Vulkan, and WebGPU versions of context, resources, error, and memory tests
     - [ ] Add more comprehensive tests for each backend

4. **Examples and Documentation**:
   - [ ] Fix examples:
     - [ ] Refactor examples/basic/drawing_main.cpp to use the LabFont abstraction instead of direct WebGPU headers
     - [ ] Create simpler examples that demonstrate core functionality without requiring all backends
